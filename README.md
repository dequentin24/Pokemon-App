# My Pokemon App!

# Why did I make this app?
I grew up watching pokemon and i've always loved the games. I wanted to just see if i could even all the api to show the data needed to make this. It was a resounding success.

# How's it made
I created this to help me with using API's All I did was call the api and placed the attributes from the thumbnail component to the main app. I then made the funky looking css with a tutorial.
